## About UniCPP
UniCPP is an experimental framework maintained by KaiDamu, a compilation of useful code applicable for many situations.

## Aspects
- **Universal** - It can be used for many purposes, from providing much for a small tool, to aiding a big project
- **Fast** - The framework uses and maintains optimized C/C++ code, therefore generally performant
- **Easy to use** - The names are written in a consistent style, therefore easy to learn
- **Cross-platform** - The platform-specific details are abstracted, otherwise made explicit, supports both MSVC and GCC
- **Open-source** - It is free to use and modify (see LICENSE)
- **Lightweight** - The code aims to be short and concise
