# UniCPP
### *The unique universal C++ framework for off-brand codery*

## About UniCPP
UniCPP is an experimental framework, a compilation of years of universal-looking code I made.

## Features
- **Universal** - It can be used for any purpose, from making a small tool to making a full game.
- **Fast** - The framework uses optimized C/C++ code, therefore fast.
- **Easy to use** - The names are written in a consistent style, therefore easy to learn.
- **Cross-platform** - It can be compiled for both Windows and Linux, supports both MSVC and GCC.
- **Open-source** - It is free to use and modify (see LICENSE).
- **Lightweight** - Relative to C, the code is made to be short and concise.
